                    <h3>I chose my Physical DofE section as my 6-month long section. I love playing tennis and that's one of the main reasons I chose to play tennis for my DofE section. I did and still do Tennis every Tuesday and Saturday at <a href="">West End Lawn Tennis Club</a> where I'm assessed by the Head Coach Bailey Harkness. Tennis is a great Cardio-Vascular sport, getting your heart pumping in no time. It's a sport of great techniques and coordination and requires a lot of effort to practise. Focusing on techniques, I chose my main goal for this seciton to be able to pickup Backhands more efficiently, and I'm still working to do so.</h3>

                    <h3>Tennis has helped me out a lot. It has helped me to gain confidence in myself and my skills. Tennis allows me to think positively of myself whenever I play, e.g. if I win a hard played match, or maybe even score a perfect winner. Not only have i developed mentally by playing tennis, I have also developed physical capabilities such as cardio vascular endurance(stamina) through the constant running and competition to get the ball at all ends of the court. It has also made me quite flexible as I may have to do some stretches to get maybe some volleys, thus even making me much more agile than before. Tennis has also helped me to learn to concentrate as well as boost my instincts, specifically in vollies. At the end of the day, I'm proud to be fit in all forms and what helped me to achieve this was Tennis through DOFE.

                    <h3>I chose to help out my local Tennis club by helping the Coach teach children aged under 10. Although the growing number of children coming to play tennis biweekly at our local court, the amount of supervisors was in decline. So, I decided to volunteer to help the main Coach once every week on Saturday mornings. I helped the Coach to maintain the court after each 20 minute drill, fed balls to children so they could keep playing, ppicked up balls after every drill, and rallied with some of them to keep their positive charisma going on throughout their lesson, because without motivation, nothing can be achieved. I believe I did a great job.</h3>

                    <h3>My main goal for volunteering was to get rid of my social anxiety. I am quite a socially-awkwards person and starting a conversation is not my type of thing. I decided that I would gain confidence in myself and talk to people without any problem. If there'd be any issues with someone's e.g. form, I would point that out, if some did great, I would compliment them. Before I knew it, I found confidence in myself talking to other people and it was no longer awkward for me to convey what I felt. I loved helping out and motivating the trainees and benefitted myself on the way. I also explored respect for those elderly to you as I got to work with many Coaches, who all had different mindsets and beleifs, making me widely open to much more than what is my daily usual.</h3>

                    <h3>We have landed back to where we started. I chose Website design for my DofE skills section. This was because of my emerging interest in HTML and react JS. I decided to challenge myself to build up my JS skills from scratch and create a catchy webpage that would include everything I have done from the start of my DofE journey. I wanted and still want to create a website that reacts on scroll, like the ones Apple or Amazon do, pretty cool! This website is like my final assessment of if I will be able to make it work on scroll.

                    <h3>I learnt a lot over all of these 3 months I did skills. I started off with justifying integers to a variable and writing algorithms to creating functions that automate like an AI. I created the fibonacci sequence generator using just Js and a command. I even made a sketchy love calculator filter sort of thing and atlast a computer that will play games with you, e.g. FizzBuzz. I used what I learnt to create a table tester that anyone can use and is fully functional. Keep your streak by answering questions and lose all progress when you get something wrong. Click the button to start if you dare! - <button onclick="tableTester()">Table Tester</button> </h3>
